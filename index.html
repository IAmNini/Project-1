        <br>
        <p class="content-body">
          Earth has run out of resources and is still recovering from the third galactic war. The only hope for pac-people is a special pac-man named YOU. 
          <br>
          You have been sent on a mission to a far-away galaxy to find the only material that can save your planet. The GLOBTROP CRYSTALS, owned by the people of the planet TRO-EZAI. 
          <br>
          Your mission is to enter their military space and collect the crystals. This won't be easy because the TRO-EZAINIANS are excellent space warriors and will not let you run away with their precious crystals. 
          <br>
          Unfortunately your ship was hit and you only have your space suit to protect you. You must navigate through the asteroids to collect all of the crystals before you run out of oxygen.
